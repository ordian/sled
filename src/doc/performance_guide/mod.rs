//! ## Built-In Profiler
//! 
//! To get a summary of latency histograms relating to different operations you've used on a sled database, sled can print a nice table when the Db is dropped by disabling the `no_metrics` default feature and setting `print_profile_on_drop(true)` on a `ConfigBuilder`:
//! 
//! ```rust
//! let config = sled::ConfigBuilder::new()
//!     .print_profile_on_drop(true)
//!     .build();
//! 
//! let db = sled::Db::start(config).unwrap();
//! ```
//! 
//! This is useful for finding outliers, general percentiles about usage, and especially for debugging performance issues if you create an issue on github.
//! 
//! ## Use jemalloc
//! 
//! jemalloc can dramatically improve performance in some situations, but you should always measure performance before and after using it, because maybe for some use cases it can cause regressions.
//! 
//! Cargo.toml:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! jemallocator = "0.1"
//! ```
//! 
//! `your_code.rs`:
//! ```rust
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static ALLOC: jemallocator::Jemalloc = jemallocator::Jemalloc;
//! ```
